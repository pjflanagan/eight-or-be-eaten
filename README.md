# 8 Or Be Eaten

8 Or Be Eaten is simple, catch enough food to stay alive while avoiding predators. You are an octopus perched
on an undersea cliff. Uncurl your many tentacles to reach down into the abyss and catch your prey, but watch out
sharks lurk in these waters and they can tear you limb from limb. 

Control the limbs with 1-8 and Q-I. Press space to use your emergency ink.
